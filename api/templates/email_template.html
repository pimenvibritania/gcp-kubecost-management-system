    <p>We understand the significance of cost management and aim to keep you informed about any fluctuations to ensure transparency and accountability. 
    As part of our efforts to offer better insights, we have integrated a weighted analysis of our services. 
    This weighting mechanism, based on the parameters provided in the spreadsheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L9XDJa4yDsSSEy26RwbNQEOFvvf6t43VuC74VRZctkA/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living Documents - Moladin Service List</a> helps us identify key cost drivers and understand their impact on the overall cost structure. 
    This approach enables us to focus on areas that require attention and optimize costs effectively to every tech family on moladin.
    <br/>
    If you have any questions or concerns regarding the cost differences or any other related matter, 
    please feel free to reach out to our dedicated support team at [contact email/phone].</p>
    Thank you for your attention to this matter. We appreciate your continued trust and partnership.</p>
